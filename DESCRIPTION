Package: RNAseqData.HNRNPC.bam.chr14
Title: Aligned reads from RNAseq experiment: Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of HNRNPC knockdown and control HeLa cells
Description: The package contains 8 BAM files, 1 per sequencing run. Each
	BAM file was obtained by (1) aligning the reads (paired-end) to the
	full hg19 genome with TopHat2, and then (2) subsetting to keep only
	alignments on chr14. See accession number E-MTAB-1147 in the
	ArrayExpress database for details about the experiment, including links
	to the published study (by Zarnack et al., 2012) and to the
	FASTQ files.
